# Data Structures in Java

Yes, these structures exist as built-in Java objects. The purpose of this
project is to practice by implementing them.

## To-do

- Doubly-linked list

- Stack

- Queue

- Set

- Hashmap

- Heap

## Completed

### Singly-linked list

- View
  my [source file.](src/main/java/com/thomasbreydo/datastructures/SinglyLinkedList.java)

- View
  my [unit tests.](src/test/java/com/thomasbreydo/datastructures/SinglyLinkedListTest.java)

Singly-linked nodes only keep track of their successor so there is no easy way
to iterate backward. Certain operations are O(n) instead of O(1) because to find
a preceding node one must iterate from the start of the list.
